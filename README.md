It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control over them.

You don’t have to use eject. The default feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you can customize it as needed.
